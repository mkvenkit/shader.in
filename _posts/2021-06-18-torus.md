# Introduction 

Intro...

# Objective 

In this project we will render a torus using the OpenGL. 

These are the topics we will be covering in this article:

- Code Structure 
- Creating Axis and a Plane 
- Creating the torus geometry 
- Lighting Model 
    - Gouraud Shading
    - Phong Shading 
    - Rim Lighting
- Texture Mapping 
- Procedura Textures  
- Bump Mapping 

Now let's get started.

# Code Structure 

We will use C++ 17 and OpenGL for this project. We will also leverage the following external 
libraries:

- [GLFW][1] - a cross platform OpenGL windowing library.
- [glad][2] - a OpenGL function loader.
- [glm][3] - an amazing C++ headers-only GLSL compatible library for 3D graphics math.

This project is part of my "Notes on Computer Graphics" github repo. Please check the [Downloads](#downloads) section for details.
