# Introduction 

OpenGL 

Vulkan...


# Objective 

In this project we will render a torus using the OpenGL. 

These are the topics we will be covering in this article:

- [Project Overview](#project-overview)
- Modern OpenGL Code Structure
- Creating Axis and Plane 
- Creating the torus geometry 
- Lighting Model 
    - Gouraud Shading
    - Phong Shading 
    - Rim Lighting
- Texture Mapping 
- Procedura Textures  
- Bump Mapping 

I'll assume that you have some background in C++ and OpenGL. In my articles, I'll be mostly focusing on the math and explanation of graphics techniques. The full code listings can be found in the link in the (#downloads) section.

Now let's get started.

# Project Overview 

We will use C++ 17 and OpenGL for this project. We will also leverage the following external 
libraries:

- [GLFW][1] - a cross platform OpenGL windowing library.
- [glad][2] - a OpenGL function loader. (Incuded in repo.)
- [glm][3] - an amazing C++ headers-only GLSL compatible library for 3D graphics math.
- [stb][4] - a single file image loading library. (Included in repo.)

This project is part of my "Notes on Computer Graphics" github repo. Please check the [Downloads](#downloads) section for details.

# Modern OpenGL Code Structure

We will be using OpenGL 4.5 for this projects. Here's the overall structure of our project. (This is a template for most modern OpenGL projects.)

1. Load the required GLSL shaders. 
2. Create the geometry for the 3D object - vertices, normals, texture coordinates, etc.
3. 


# Axis and Plane 

Before we start with a torus, we'll define two other useful 

# Torus Geometry 



A torus can be described using the following parametric equations:

$$
x & = (R + r \cos{v}) \cos{u} \\
y & = (R + r \cos{v}) \sin{u} \\
z & = r \sin{v}
$$

Normals are given by:

$$
N_x & = \cos{v} \cos{u} \\
N_y & = \cos{v} \sin{u} \\
N_z & = \sin{v}
$$


# Lighting Model 

Here's the lighting model for our project.
