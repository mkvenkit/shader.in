# Introduction 

Intro...

# Objective 

In this project we want to render a torus in 

These are the topics we will be covering in this article:

- [Code Structure][#code-structure] 
- Creating Axis and a Plane 
- Creating the torus geometry 
- Lighting Model 
    - Gouraud Shading
    - Phong Shading 
    - Rim Lighting
- Texture Mapping 
- Procedura Textures  
- Bump Mapping 

Now let's get started.
